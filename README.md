# Interactive Story iOS App

Way back in the day, one of the more popular style of children's books were the [Choose Your Own Adventure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure) type. Where your choices dictated how the narrative played out. In a similar vein, some of the earliest computer games were text adventure games, where you made a few choices to progress through an adventure. This application is a short space adventure game inspired by that story.
